# Idealization

Some people miss out on playing some of the most popular games simply because they don't have a partner to play with. That’s the problem that inspired this project.

The initial idea was to create a game designed for pairs, but if a user doesn’t have someone to play with, they can play with an AI tool that learns alongside them, adjusting its abilities based on the user’s skills. This idea was later refined, and now the goal is to develop an AI model that can learn how to play by being given the game's instructions, making it adaptable to any two-player game.

This is not meant to replace a second player, but rather to ensure that if someone doesn’t have a partner, they can still enjoy the game.

1. **Differ bots and players**

    Launching a software application that can differentiate bots from real players in games. Advancements in AI have fueled a rise and human gamers say these bots ruin the fun in part by putting them at a skill disadvantage.

2. **Talk with the characters and process responses in real time**

    Sony is working on a prototype AI-powered version of at least one its PlayStation game characters. The prototype uses AI-powered version of Aloy that can hold a conversation with a player through voice prompts during gameplay. Aloy could be seen responding to queries with an AI-powered synthesized voice and facial movements. 

    The technology demo uses OpenAI’s whisper for speech-to-text, and both GPT-4 and Llama 3 for conversations and decision making. Sony’s has its own internal Emotional Voice Synthesis (EVS) system that it uses for speech generation, according to Raghoebardajal, and audio to face animation is powered by Sony’s own Mockingbird technology. 

    Nvidia has been working on its own similar technology for AI-powered NPCs in games, where you speak freely to video game characters. Microsoft has also been partnering closely with Inworld AI to eventually bring AI characters to Xbox, allowing game developers to use generative AI characters, storylines, and more. Microsoft has also created its own Muse AI model that generates gameplay, designed initially for game developers to create a game environment for prototyping and ideating.

3. **AI model could generate examples of gameplay from a single screenshot**

    That’s the idea behind Microsoft’s Muse, a transformer. The result is a model that, when prompted with a screenshot of the game, can generate multiple examples of gameplay, which can extend up to several minutes in length.

    Muse (also known as the World and Human Action Model, or WHAM) was trained on human gameplay data from the multiplayer action game Bleeding Edge. 

    Muse isn’t the first AI model capable of generating gameplay. Notable predecessors include Google DeepMind’s Genie, Tencent’s GameGen-X, and GameNGen. Unlike prior models, Muse was trained on real-world human gameplay data that includes image data from gameplay and corresponding controller inputs. Genie and GameGen-X, by contrast, didn’t have access to controller inputs and instead trained on publicly available image data from various games.

    Muse also uses an autoregressive transformer architecture, which is uncommon for a model that generates images (gameplay, like video, is a series of images in sequence). GameNGen and GameGen-X, meanwhile, use specialized diffusion models to generate gameplay, and again don’t model controller input.

    **Muse and the WHAM Demonstrator are available for download from HuggingFace.**

    The clips are generated at a resolution of just 380 by 180 pixels and 10 frames per second, which is far too low for an enjoyable gameplay experience. Muse is also limited to generating gameplay similar to Bleeding Edge.

    4. **Build videogames**

    Liminal Experiences Inc.  is creating a toll that allows users to build their own role playing-style video games using artificial intelligence tools that create characters, environments and storylines.

    5. **Talk like a friend with Gemini**

    Gemini asked about my weekend plans, and then I asked if it liked to play games.

    It created the following game:
    ~~~
    "You find yourself standing at the edge of a whispering forest. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and ancient trees. A narrow path winds its way into the depths of the woods, disappearing into the shadows. To your left, you see a crumbling stone wall, partially overgrown with ivy. To your right, a small, gurgling stream flows from the forest, its water dark and clear.

    What do you do?

    Options:

    1 Follow the path into the forest.

    2 Examine the stone wall.

    3 Follow the stream.

    4 Listen to the sounds of the forest.
