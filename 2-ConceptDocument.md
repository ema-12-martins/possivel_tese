# Premise (high concept) 

A robot has crashed into Earth from another galaxy, and as a kind-hearted person, you decide to help it recover its missing parts. To do this, you must travel to different planets in search of the robot’s components. There are two levels of difficulty: the easier one involves finding simple items like screws, while the harder one includes locating parts of the robot’s body.

Some parts can only be found by solving puzzles. To do so, you and your robotic companion, equipped with the parts you've already recovered, must work together to complete the challenges. Other can be found alone.

The robot can be controlled by a friend or, when no partner is available, by an AI.

# Player motivation

The main motivation is to help the robot recover all its missing pieces. Each part is added to the robot as soon as it is found, allowing the player to see the progress visually. The player wins once all the pieces have been collected across the different worlds.

# Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

What makes it different is that it's a co-op game, but you don’t need a second player to enjoy it — you can play alongside the AI instead.

# Target market

Persons that like co-op game but don't have a partner. The game will record the progress after found a new piece, so the player can play long or short games.
